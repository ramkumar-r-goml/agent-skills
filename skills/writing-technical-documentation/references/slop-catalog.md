# AI writing pattern catalog

An exhaustive list of patterns that mark text as machine-generated or machine-flavored, with the fix for each. Use it in Phase 6 and when cleaning someone's draft. Run `scripts/slop_scan.py` first; it covers the lexical and formatting patterns. The structural and semantic ones need your judgment.

## 0. How to use this catalog

- One instance is a yellow flag. Three or more in different categories in a short span is a cluster, and clusters are the signal.
- Fix the cause: a vague sentence needs a fact. Synonym swaps keep the emptiness. If you cannot find the fact, delete the sentence or ask.
- Do not over-police. Formal register, correct grammar, a transition word, a list, or a heading is not a defect by itself. Humans use all of these. Detection by pattern is probabilistic; the goal is good prose, not evasion.
- Vocabulary lists rotate with model generations. Structural patterns persist. Weight structure over words.

## 1. Root causes

| Root cause | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No specific facts | Abstract nouns, adjectives, "various", "numerous" | Add names, numbers, paths, commands |
| No stance | Hedging, both-sides, "it depends" without conditions | Commit, or state the condition that decides |
| No reader in mind | Generic intros, "whether you're a beginner or expert" | Name the reader and their next action |
| Padding to look thorough | Restatement, summaries, preambles | Delete test |
| Optimizing for sounding authoritative | Significance inflation, grand claims | State the fact and let it carry weight |
| Template-filling | Same shape in every section, rule of three | Shape the section to its content |
| Avoiding risk of being wrong | Vague attribution, "can help", "may" | Verify, then state; or mark unverified |
| Imitating style of marketing or essays | Hype, rhetorical questions, dramatic reveals | Plain declarative sentences |

"It may potentially be possible that...", "can often help to some extent." Fix: pick the claim or state the condition.

### 4.10 Em-dash overuse
Em dashes used for asides, drama, or in place of commas, colons, or periods, especially several per paragraph. Fix: use a period, comma, colon, or parentheses. (Em dashes are not proof of AI; density is the signal.)

### 4.11 Colon reveals
"The solution: X." "Here's the thing: X." Fix: plain sentence.

### 4.12 Dramatic fragments
Short punchy fragments for effect ("Simple. Fast. Secure." "Period." "Full stop." "And that's the point."). Fix: one real sentence.

### 4.13 Anaphora and repeated frames

"magic", "smart", "seamless" in quotes. Fix: delete or define.

### 4.23 Pseudo-profound abstractions

Every section: heading, one-line intro, three bullets, one-line outro. Fix: shape to content.

### 5.5 Heading inflation
Many headings over very little text. H3s with one sentence. Fix: merge.

### 5.6 Filler sections
Overview, Introduction, Conclusion, Best Practices, Key Considerations, Benefits, Use Cases, Future Work, Challenges and Opportunities, Final Thoughts. They are present because templates have them, with generic content. Fix: delete sections with no project-specific content.

## 6. Tone and stance

- Promotional: adjectives about the product's quality; "world-class"; superlatives. Fix: facts.
- Cheerleading: exclamation marks, "Great news!", "Exciting".
- Sycophancy toward the reader: "You're absolutely right", "Great choice".
- Condescension: simply, just, easy, obviously, clearly, of course, trivial, straightforward, "all you need to do". Fix: delete; give the step.
- Authority posturing: "experts agree", "studies show", "it is widely believed", "industry best practice" with no source. Fix: name the source or own the claim.
- Vague attribution: "some argue", "many developers", "critics say". Fix: who, where.
- Neutral to the point of emptiness: no stance on a design question that has an answer in the code.
- Moralizing: "It's crucial to prioritize security." Fix: say the specific control required.
- Euphemism: "encountered challenges", "suboptimal performance", "opportunities for improvement", "areas for growth", "unexpected behavior". Fix: say what broke.

- Inflated stakes: "critical", "vital", "game-changing" for ordinary details.
- Overclaiming universality: "always", "never", "all", "every" without checking. Fix: verify or qualify with the condition.
- Overpromising: "guarantees", "ensures" for what is best effort. Fix: describe the actual guarantee and its limits.

## 7. Formatting and encoding

- Em dashes (U+2014) in density; en dashes used as em dashes.
- Curly (smart) quotes and apostrophes in Markdown or code-adjacent files.
- Unicode arrows and symbols (U+2192, U+21D2, U+2713, U+2714, U+2022 as inline bullet, U+2026 ellipsis) in prose or source docs.
- Emojis in headings, bullets, or status markers (checkmarks, rockets, sparkles, light bulbs, warning signs).
- Bold sprinkled through paragraphs; bold on every list lead-in.
- Title Case Headings For Everything.
- Headings ending in colons or questions.
- Excessive horizontal rules.
- Inconsistent list markers within a file.
- Tables with one column or used for layout.
- Code blocks without language tags; commands with `$` prompts in copy blocks.
- Long inline-code strings of prose.
- Markdown artifacts in plain text: stray `**`, `##`, backticks inside non-Markdown output.
- Hidden or zero-width characters, non-breaking spaces, trailing whitespace pasted from chat UIs.
- Placeholder brackets left in: `[Insert X]`, `[Your Name]`, `TODO`, `TBD`, `lorem ipsum`.
- Turn-key citations markup leaked from tools (`oaicite`, `contentReference`, `turn0search0`, `utm_source=chatgpt.com`, `:contentReference[oaicite:0]`).
- Broken or fabricated reference markup; footnotes pointing nowhere.
- Overlong lines or decorative ASCII boxes.

Fix: normalize to plain ASCII punctuation, sentence case, minimal formatting.

## 8. Technical-documentation-specific patterns

- README opens with a tagline of adjectives instead of what the software does.
- "Features" list of benefits with no behavior ("Blazing fast performance", "Easy to use").
- "Why X?" section that sells.
- Badges and emoji decoration standing in for information.
- Installation steps that skip prerequisites or versions.
- Quick start that does not produce a visible result.
- Commands or flags that do not exist; examples that cannot run.
- Architecture text that describes layers named in the abstract ("presentation layer, business layer, data layer") with no mapping to directories.
- Diagrams with generic boxes ("Backend", "Database", "API") and no real names.
- Component descriptions that restate the name ("The UserService handles user-related operations").
- "Handles", "manages", "processes", "supports" as the only verbs. Fix: name the operations.
- Docstrings that restate the signature.
- Comments that narrate the next line.
- Config tables without defaults, units, or valid ranges.
- Error docs that say "ensure your configuration is correct".
- Troubleshooting that says "check the logs" with no log location or pattern.
- "Best practices" lists unconnected to the repo.
- Security sections of boilerplate ("we take security seriously") with no controls.
- Performance claims without benchmark data.
- Scalability claims without limits or tests.
- "Future-proof", "extensible", "modular" without extension points named.
- ADRs with no rejected alternatives or no costs.
- Design docs with goals and no non-goals; non-goals that are negations of goals.
- Postmortems that blame people, or name "human error" as root cause, or have action items without owners.
- Runbooks with prose paragraphs instead of commands and expected outputs.
- Onboarding guides with no times, no access list, no first task.
- Changelogs that list commits instead of user-visible changes.
- Migration guides without before and after code or rollback.
- Docs describing planned features as shipped.
- Docs that mention the time of writing ("currently", "new in this release") with no version.
- Documents that never mention a failure case.
- A "Limitations" section that is generic ("may not be suitable for all use cases").
- Vendor-neutral mush where the repo clearly uses one vendor; hide-the-name abstractions.
- Repeating the file tree as a bullet list with one-line restatements of folder names.
- AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md that is a long essay, repeats the README, or lists rules a linter enforces.

## 9. Claude-specific and chat-assistant tells

These recur in text from recent Claude models and other chat assistants. They are structural and tonal rather than lexical.

- Words: "genuinely", "load-bearing", "honest" (as a flag: "honestly", "to be honest"), "straightforward", "worth", "substantive", "compelling", "nuanced", "rigorous", "thoughtful", "careful", "precisely", "surfaces" (verb), "lands" (verb), "sits" ("sits at the intersection"), "carries weight", "unpacks", "grounded", "robust", "the real X", "the actual issue", "the key insight".
- Bold-lead bullets in nearly every list.
- Arrow shorthand in prose or lists (A -> B) outside code.
- Sentences that begin with a reaction: "That's a great point", "That makes sense", "You're right".
- "Let me" / "I'll" narrations inside documents.
- Closing offers: "Would you like me to...", "Let me know if...".
- Trailing "In short," summaries after each section.
- Em dashes for asides and contrasts at a high rate.
- "Not X, but Y" in the second sentence of a paragraph.
- Over-use of "that said" and "worth noting".
- Parenthetical asides after nearly every claim.
- Lists of exactly three items with parallel wording.
- Section headers phrased as slogans.
- Self-reference: "this document", "this guide", "this section" announcing itself.
- Confident but unsourced specifics.
- Meta-commentary about quality: "I want to be careful here", "to be precise".
- Disclaimers about limits inside deliverables.
Fix: apply sections 3 to 7; delete assistant voice from deliverables.

## 10. Fabrication patterns

Treat as defects, not style.
- Non-existent flags, functions, files, endpoints, packages, versions.
- Plausible but wrong defaults or units.
- Fabricated metrics, benchmarks, percentages, dates.
- Fabricated quotes or citations; real-looking but dead URLs; wrong authors or years.
- Invented people, teams, SLAs, compliance claims.
- Output blocks written from imagination.
- Copy-forward of a claim from an old README that the code contradicts.
- Descriptions of what the code "should" do.
- Fake precision (values with false decimals).
Fix: Phase 2 and Phase 5 of the workflow.

## 11. Leaked-assistant artifacts

Delete on sight: "As an AI", "I cannot browse", "knowledge cutoff", "I don't have access to", "Here is the revised version", "Certainly! Here's", "I hope this helps", "Let me know", "Sure, here", prompts or instructions echoed in the text, "[Your Name]", "[Company]", "Note to self", markup like `oaicite`, `contentReference`, `turn0search`, `utm_source=chatgpt.com`, `citeturn`, `grok_card`, "Source: [1]" with no list, and tool-call remnants.

## 12. Not reliable indicators

Do not flag these alone, and do not "fix" them just to look human:
- Correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
- Formal register or neutral tone in reference docs.
- Parallel list structure in a real list.
- Use of "however" or "therefore" where the logic needs it.
- A table, headings, or a numbered list.
- Short paragraphs.
- Consistent terminology (it is a goal).
- Em dashes in a small number, in a quoted source, or in a style where they were already the norm.
- A summary at the top of a long document.
- Passive voice where the actor is irrelevant or unknown.
- Uniformity enforced by a style guide.
- Non-native English that is clear and plain.
Adding errors, slang, or quirks to fake humanity is a failure. Aim for specific, plain, accurate.

## 13. Model generations and drift

- Word-level tells shift as models change: "delve" peaked in earlier generations and declined; newer outputs favor other words (genuinely, load-bearing, surface, land, sit). Do not rely on a fixed list.
- Structure persists across generations: negative parallelism, rule of three, bold-lead bullets, preambles and recaps, significance inflation, trailing participles, uniform section shape.
- Detectors are probabilistic. Do not claim a text is AI or human on the basis of a score. Use the catalog to improve text.
- Re-read this catalog's vocabulary lists with suspicion every few months; add what you see in current outputs.

## 14. Scoring and clusters

`slop_scan.py` weights hits by category and reports per 1,000 words. Rough guide: under 5 is clean for technical docs; 5 to 15 needs a pass; above 15 needs a rewrite from the evidence ledger. Treat the score as a prompt for judgment: a short README with two hits can be worse than a long guide with five.

A cluster is three or more different categories within about 150 words. Fix clusters first.

## 15. Rewrite procedure

1. Mark every sentence the scanner and your read flagged.
2. For each, ask: what fact should be here? Look it up in the ledger or the code.
3. If a fact exists: rewrite the sentence around it.
4. If no fact exists: delete the sentence.
5. If the reader needs the idea but you lack the fact: ask the user or mark `[unverified: ...]`.
6. After rewrites, check for new tells introduced by the rewrite (often "ensuring", em dashes, and bold leads).
7. Rescan. Read once for flow and sentence-length variation.
8. Report the score change and any facts still missing.
